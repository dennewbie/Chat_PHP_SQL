# Chat PHP SQL

Simple chat for website in realtime
Front-End: HTML, CSS, JS
Back-End: SQL, PHP 5


# Usage: 
Once you download the project, you need at least a local server installed on your PC such as XAMPP, UwAmp or others.


# Disclaimer:
Most of the files are in Italian languages since this was a project that I developed while I was in high school.
Furthermore, it's very basically since when I've done this, I was at the beginning of IT studies.
This was the final product for an exam on Back-End languages. The assignment was to create a chat system based on PHP.
